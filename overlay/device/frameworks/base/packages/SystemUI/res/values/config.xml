    <!-- Doze: a list of pickup sensor subtypes that perform a proximity check before they trigger.
               If not empty, either * or !* must appear to specify the default.

               Examples: 1,2,3,!* -> subtypes 1,2 and 3 perform the check, all others don't.
                         !1,!2,*  -> subtypes 1 and 2 don't perform the check, all others do.
                         !8,*     -> subtype 8 does not perform the check, all others do
                         1,1,*    -> illegal, every item may only appear once
                         1,!1,*   -> illegal, no contradictions allowed
                         1,2      -> illegal, need either * or !*
                         1,,4a3   -> illegal, no empty or non-numeric terms allowed
